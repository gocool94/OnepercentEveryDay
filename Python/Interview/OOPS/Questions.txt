1. **Class and Objects:**
   - Implement a class for a simple bank account with methods for deposit, withdraw, and checking balance.
   - Create a class hierarchy for different types of vehicles (car, bike, truck) with shared and specific attributes/methods.

2. **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
   - Create a base class `Shape` with subclasses `Circle` and `Rectangle`. Implement methods to calculate area for each shape.
   - Design a class structure for a library system with `Person`, `Author`, and `Book` classes using inheritance.

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - Implement a `Student` class with private attributes for name, age, and grade. Provide methods to access and modify these attributes.
   - Create a class for a `BankAccount` with a private attribute for balance and methods for deposit and withdrawal.

4. **Abstraction:**
   - Implement an abstract class `Animal` with subclasses `Dog` and `Cat`. Define common and specific methods for each subclass.
   - Design an abstract class `Shape` with subclasses for different shapes. Implement a method to calculate perimeter in each subclass.

5. **Method Overriding and Overloading:**
   - Create a base class `Person` with a method `introduce`. Create subclasses `Student` and `Teacher` that override the `introduce` method.
   - Implement a class `Calculator` with methods for addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Use method overloading to support different argument types.

6. **Composition and Aggregation:**
   - Create a class `Department` with a list of `Employee` objects as an attribute to represent employee aggregation.
   - Implement a class `Car` with a composition relationship to `Engine` and `Wheel` objects.

7. **Interfaces and Abstract Methods:**
   - Define an interface `Shape` with an abstract method `calculate_area`. Implement this interface in classes like `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
   - Create an abstract class `Transport` with methods for `start`, `stop`, and `accelerate`. Implement this in classes like `Car` and `Bike`.

8. **Static and Class Methods:**
   - Implement a class `Math` with static methods for common mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).
   - Create a class `Employee` with a class method to calculate the average salary of all employees.

9. **Operator Overloading:**
   - Overload the `+` operator for a class `Vector` to perform vector addition.
   - Implement custom comparison methods to compare two objects of a class based on a specific attribute.

10. **Design Patterns:**
    - Implement the Singleton pattern for a class `Logger` to ensure only one instance is created.
    - Use the Factory Method pattern to create different types of `Product` objects based on a given input.

11. **Dependency Injection:**
    - Create a class `EmailSender` that takes an instance of `Logger` as a dependency to log emails sent.
    - Implement a class `PaymentProcessor` that accepts a payment gateway as a parameter to process payments.

12. **Composition Over Inheritance:**
    - Design a class structure for a drawing application using composition to create complex shapes.
    - Create a class `Animal` and a class `Sound` that can be composed to represent the sound an animal makes.

13. **Duck Typing and Polymorphism:**
    - Implement a function that accepts any object with a `speak` method and calls it to produce a sound.
    - Create a generic class `Container` that accepts and manages any type of objects.

14. **Method Chaining:**
    - Implement a class `StringBuilder` with methods to append, reverse, and get the final string. Enable method chaining.
    - Design a class `Query` with methods to add conditions, select columns, and execute the query. Enable method chaining.

15. **Data Hiding and Encapsulation:**
    - Create a class `Person` with private attributes for name and age, and methods to access and update them.
    - Implement a class `BankAccount` with a private attribute for balance and methods to deposit and withdraw money.
